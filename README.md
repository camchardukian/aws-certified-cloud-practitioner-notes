# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner - Notes

This repository contains the notes I have taken while preparing for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.

Disclaimer: I never ended up sitting the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam, but I did successfully pass the higher level AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam. If you're interested, you can find [my AWS SAA notes here](https://github.com/camchardukian/aws-saa-notes).
