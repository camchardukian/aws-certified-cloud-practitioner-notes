# ML & AI

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** -- Machines that perform jobs that mimic human behavior.

- **Machine Learning (ML)** -- Machines that get better at a task without explicit programming.

- **Deep Learning (DL)** -- Machines that have an artificial neural network inspired by the human brain to solve complex problems.

- **Amazon SageMaker** -- A fully managed service to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale.

## Big Data

_Big Data_ is a term used to describe massive volumes of data that are so large as to be difficult to move and process using traditional database and software techniques.

_ETL_ or 'Extract Transform, Load' services allow us to not only move data from one location to another but also to perform transformations before arriving at the final destination.

A _data lake_ is a storage repository that holds a vast amount of raw data in its native format until it is needed.

## Amazon QuickSight

_Amazon QuickSight_ is a Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboard that allows us to ingest data from various AWS storage or database services to quickly visualize business data with minimal programming or data formula knowledge.
