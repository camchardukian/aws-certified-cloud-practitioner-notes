## Computing Power

Three types of computing are general computing, GPU computing, and quantum computing.

GPU computing could be estimated to be roughly 50x faster than general computing, while quantum computing can end up being millions of times faster than general computing.

AWS offers _Elastic Compute Cloud_ (EC2) for general computing, _AWS Inferentiare_ (Inf1) for GPU computing, and _AWS Bracket_ (via CalTech) for quantum computing.
