# AWS Well Architected Framework

The AWS Well-Architected Framework is a whitepaper created by AWS to help customers build using best practices defined by AWS.

The framework is divided in 5 sections called pillars with the five pillars being:

1. **Operational Excellence** -- Runs and monitors systems
1. **Security** -- Protects data and systems, mitigates risk
1. **Reliability** -- Mitigates and recovers from disruptions
1. **Performance Efficiency** -- Use computing resources effectively
1. **Cost Optimization** -- Get the lowest price

## General Definitions

**Component** -- Code, configuration, and AWS resources against a requirement

**Workload** -- A set of components that work together to deliver business value

**Milestones** -- Key changes of your architecture through the product life cycle.

**Architecture** -- How components work together in a workload

**Technology Portfolio** -- A collection of workloads required for the business to operate

## Operational Excellence Design Principles

- Perform operations as code
- Make frequent, small, reversible changes
- Refine operations procedures frequently
- Anticipate failure
- Learn from all operational failures

## Security Design Principles

- Implement a strong identity foundation
- Enable traceability
- Apply security at all layers
- Automate security best practices
- Protect data in transit and at rest
- Keep people away from data
- Prepare for security events

## Reliability Design Principles

- Automatically recover from failure
- Test recovery procedures
- Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
- Stop guessing capacity
- Manage change in automation

## Performance Efficiency Design Principles

- Democratize advanced technologies
- Go global in minutes
- Use serverless architecture
- Experiment more often
- Consider mechanical sympathy

## Cost Optimization Design Principles

- Implement Cloud Financial Management
- Adopt a consumption model
- Measure overall efficiency
- Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
- Analyze and attribute expenditure

## AWS Well-Architected Tool

The Well-Architected Tool is essentially a checklist that can be used to assess our cloud workloads for alignment with the AWS Well Architected Framework.

## AWS Architecture Center

The AWS Architecture Center is a web portal that contains best practices and reference architectures for a variety of different workloads.
