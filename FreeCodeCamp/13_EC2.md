# EC2

_Elastic Compute Cloud_ (EC2) is a highly configurable virtual server.

## EC2 Instance Families

_Instance Families_ are different combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.

The five categories of instance families are: general purpose, compute optimized, memory optimized, accelerated optimized, and storage optimized.

## EC2 Instance Types

An _instance type_ is a particular instance size and instance family.

E2 instance sizes generally double in price and key attributes. For that reason, it's sometimes better to get an additional instance of the same size rather than a larger instance.

## EC2 Tenancy

EC2 has three levels of tenancy:

1. **Dedicated Host** -- Your server always lives in the same place and you have control of the physical attribute

1. **Dedicated Instance** -- Your server always lives in the same place.

1. **Default** -- Your server lives in one place until a reboot.
