# Shared Responsibility Model

The _Shared Responsibility Model_ is a cloud security framework that defines the security obligations of the customer and the CSP.

Basically, in the AWS Shared Responsibility Model the customer is responsible for security "in" the cloud whereas AWS is responsible for the security "of" the cloud.

In general, the customer is responsible for the configuration of access controls, configuration of cloud services, and granting access to users via permissions.

The CSP on the other hand is generally responsible for the underlying infrastructure.
