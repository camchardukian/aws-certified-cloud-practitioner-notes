## Overbilling

It's important to be careful when setting up AWS services because they will sometimes come with defaults that end up being pricier than necessary.

To avoid excessive charges, we can be careful when configuring services, setup billing alerts, and possibly contact AWS support and hope they are empathetic if we have large unexpected charges.
