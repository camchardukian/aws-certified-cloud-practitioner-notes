# TCO & Migration

_Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)_ is a financial estimate intended to help buyers and owners determine the direct and indirect costs of a product or service.

## Capital vs Operational Expenditure

**Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)** -- Spending money upfront on physical infrastructure and deducting that expense from your tax bill over time.

With capital expenses you have to guess upfront what you plan to spend.

**Operational Expenditure (OPEX)** -- The customer only has to be concerned with non-physical costs.

With operational expenses you can try a product or service without investing in equipment.

## AWS Pricing Calculator

The _AWS Pricing Calculator_ is a free cost estimate tool that can be used within our web browser (without the need for an AWS account) to estimate the costs of various AWS services.

## Migration Evaluator

_AWS Migration Evaluator_ is an estimate tool used to determine an organization's existing on-premise costs so that they can be compared against AWS costs for a planned migration to the cloud.

## EC2 VM import/Export

_VM Import/Export_ allows users to import virtual machine images into EC2.

The three steps are as follows:

1. Prepare your virtual image for upload
1. Upload your virtual image to S3
1. Using the AWS CLI, your image will be imported and an _Amazon Machine Image_ (AMI) will be generated

## Database Migration Service (DMS)

_AWS Database Migration Service_ (DMS) allows you to quickly and securely migrate one database to another.

_AWS Schema Conversion Tool_ is used in many cases to automatically convert a source database schema to a target database schema.

## Cloud Adoption Framework

The _AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)_ is a whitepaper to help you plan your migration from on-premise to AWS.

The AWS CAF organizes guidance into six focus areas regarding how to update staff skills and organizational processes to:

1. **Business Perspective** -- Optimize business value as they move ops to the cloud.
1. **People Perspective** -- Optimize and maintain workforce and ensure competencies are in place at the appropriate time.
1. **Governance Perspective** -- Ensure busines governance in the cloud, and manage/measure cloud investments to evaluate their business outcomes.
1. **Platform Perspective** -- Deliver and optimize cloud solutions and services.
1. **Security Perspective** -- Ensure the architecture deployed in the cloud aligns with the organization's security control requirements, resiliency, and compliance requirements.
1. **Operations Perspective** -- Ensure system health and reliability during the move of operations to the cloud and then to operate using agile, ongoing, cloud computing best practices.
