# Windows on AWS

AWS has several services and tools that make it easy for us to run Windows workloads on AWS.

Some of the more popular ones are:

- Windows Servers on EC2
- SQL Server on RSD
- AWS Directory Service
- AWS License Manager
- Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
- AWS Software Development Kit (SDK)
- Amazon WorkSpaces
- AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP)

## AWS License Manager

_Bring-Your-Own-License (BYOL)_ is the process of reusing an existing software license to run vendor software on a cloud vendor's computing service.

_AWS License Manager_ is a service that makes it easier for us to centrally manage software licenses from software vendors across AWS and our on-premise environments.
