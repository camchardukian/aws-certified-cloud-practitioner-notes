# Identity

The _Zero Trust Model_ operates on the principle of **trust no one, verify everything.**

_Identity-Centric_ security augments the older _Network-Centric_ security.

## Directory Service

A _directory service_ maps the names of network resources to their network addresses. _Domain Name Service (DNS)_ is an example of a well known directory service.

## Identity Providers

_Identity Provider (IdP)_ is a system entity that creates, maintains, and manages identity information for principals and also provides authentication services to applications within a federation or distributed network.

_Federated identity_ is a method of linking a user's identity across multiple separate identity management systems.

## Single Sign-On

Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID and password to different systems and software.

## LDAP

_Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)_ is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an _Internet Protocol (IP)_ network.

## Multi-Factor Authentication

_Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)_ is a security control where after you enter your username/email and password you have to use a secondary device such as a phone to confirm it's you logging in.

## Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)

The _Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)_ is a computer security concept concerned with providing a user, role, or application the least amount of permissions they need to perform an operation or action.
