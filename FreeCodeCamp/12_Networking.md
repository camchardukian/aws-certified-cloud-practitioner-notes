# Networking

## Enterprise/Hybrid Networking

**DirectConnect** -- Dedicated gigabit connection from on-premise data-center to AWS (a very fast connection).

**AWS Virtual Private Network** (VPN) -- A secure connection between on-premise, remote offices, and mobile employees.

**PrivateLinks** (VPC Interface Endpoints) -- Keeps traffic within the AWS network and not traverse the internet to keep traffic secure.

## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Subnets

**Virtual Private Cloud** (VPC) -- A logically isolated section of the AWS Network where you launch your AWS resources.

**Subnets** -- A logical partition of an IP network into multiple smaller network segments.

## Security Groups vs NACLs

**Network Access Control Lists** (NACLs) -- Act as a virtual firewall at the subnet level and allow for the creation of Allow and Deny rules.

**Security Groups** -- Act as a virtual firewall at the instance level and allow for the creation of only Allow rules.
