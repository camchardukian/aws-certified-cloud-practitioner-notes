# Cloud Concepts

## Cloud Computing

_Cloud computing_ basically refers to the practice of using a network of remote servers rather than our own personal computer/local servers.

Some of the benefits of _cloud hosting_ are that it is:

- Flexible
- Scalable
- Secure
- Cost-Effective
- Highly Configurable

## Amazon Web Services

AWS is the leading _cloud service provider_ (CSP) in the world.

## Cloud Service Provider (CSP)

Cloud service providers utilize metered billing based on usage and provide multiple cloud services.

## Common Cloud Services & Technology Overview

Cloud service providers can have dozens or hundreds of cloud services. AWS for example has 200+ cloud services.

The four most common types of cloud services are:

1. Compute
1. Networking
1. Storage
1. Databases

Even though the term "Cloud Computing" has "compute" in its name, it is often used to refer to all four types of the above services.

Some less common but still noteworthy types of cloud service offerings are: analytics, application integration, AR/VR, AWS cost management, blockchain, business applications, containers, customer engagement, developer tools, end user computing, game tech, internet of things, machine learning, management/governance, media services, migration/transfer, mobile, quantum technologies, robotics, satellites, security/identity/compliance, etc.

## The Evolution of Computing

Over the past number of years we've seen a gradual progession from dedicated machines/servers, to VMs, to containers, to functions.

A _hypervisor_ is a software layer that allows us to run VMs.

Containers can be more efficient than VMs, but they are also often significantly more work to maintain.

Functions are managed VMs running managed containers. This can be referred to as _Serverless Compute_.

Serverless computing is very cost-effective because it's only necessary to pay for the time the code is running.

However, one side-effect of this type of setup is that users will sometimes have to deal with cold starts.

## Types of Cloud Computing

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

-- A product that is run and managed by the service provider. Typically for customers.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

-- Used for focusing on the deployment and management of apps. Typically for developers.

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

-- Provides access to networking features, computers and data storage. AWS falls into this category. Typically for admins.

## Cloud Computing Deployment Models

### Public Cloud

Everything is built on the _cloud service provider_ (CSP). This is sometimes referred to as _cloud-native_ or _cloud first_.

### Private Cloud

Everything is built on the company's data centers. This is sometimes referred to as _on-premise_.

### Hybrid

Uses both on-premise and a CSP.

### Cross-Cloud

Uses multiple CSPs. Sometimes referred to as multi-cloud.
