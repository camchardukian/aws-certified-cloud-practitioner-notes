# Serverless

_Serverless_ is when the underlying servers, infrastructure, and _Operating System_ (OS) is taken care of by the _Cloud Service Provider_ (CSP). Serverless is generally highly available, scalable and cost-effective. You pay for what you use.

## Serverless Services

Some common serverless services are:

- DynamoDB -- A serverless NoSQL key/value and document database.

- Simple Storage Service (S3) -- A serverless object storage service.

- ECS Fargate -- A serverless orchestration container service.

- AWS Lambda -- A serverless functions service that allows us to run code without provisioning or managing servers.

- Step Functions -- A state machine service that coordinates multiple AWS services into serverless workflows.

- Aurora Serverless -- The serverless on-demand version of Aurora.
