# Architecting

## Well Architected Framework Overview

Here are some general guiding principles of the [Well Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html):

- Stop guessing your capacity needs
- Test systems at production scale
- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
- Allow for evolutionary architecture
- Drive architecture using data
- Improve through game days (test how your architecture and processes perform by regularly scheduling game days to simulate various events in production)

The six pillars of the _Well Architected Framework_ are:

- Operational excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance efficiency
- Cost optimization
- Sustainability

## Operational Excellence

_Operational excellence_ refers to the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

## Security

_Security_ refers to the ability to protection information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

## Reliability

_Reliability_ refers to a focus on workloads performing their intended functions and how to quickly recover from failure to meet demands.

## Performance Efficiency

_Performance efficiency_ refers to a focus on structured and streamlined allocation of IT and computing resources.

## Cost Optimization

_Cost optimization_ is a focus on avoiding unnecessary costs.

## Sustainability

_Sustainability_ refers to a focus on minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads.

## AWS Well-Architected Tool

The _AWS Well-Architected Tool_ is a free tool that can help us to review how well our architectures align with the 6 pillars of the Well-Architected Framework.

## AWS Right Sizing

_Right sizing_ is the process of matching instance types and sizes to our workload performance and capacity requirements at the lowest possible cost.

We should focus on right sizing before performing a cloud migration, and then continously at regular interval after the cloud onboarding process.
