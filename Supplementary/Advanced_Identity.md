# Advanced Identity

## AWS Security Token Service (STS)

_AWS STS_ allows us to create temporary, limited-privilege credentials to access our AWS resources.

## Amazon Cognito

_Amazon Cognito_ allows us to easily add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to our web and mobile applications.

## AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)

_AWS Single Sign-On_, now known as _AWS IAM Identity Center_ helps us to securely create or connect our workforce identities and manage their access centrally across AWS accounts and application.

In simpler terms, this service basically gives us one login for multiple AWS accounts and applications.
