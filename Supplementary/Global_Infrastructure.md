# Global Infrastructure

A global application is an application that is deployed in multiple geographies.

The benefits of having a global application are:

- Decreased latency
- Improved Disaster Recovery
- Better Protection Against Attacks

## Route 53

_Amazon Route 53_ is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service.

## CloudFront

_CloudFront_ is a _Content Delivery Network_ (CDN) that can help give users a better experience by improving read performance.

It does this by caching content in the various AWS edge locations around the world.

## S3 Transfer Acceleration

_Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration_ can help us to speed up content transfers to and from Amazon S3 by as much as 50-500% for long-distance transfer of large objects.

It does this by using network protocol optimizations and by routing traffic through Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed Edge Locations, and over AWS backbone networks.

## Global Accelerator

_Global Accelerator_ improves global application availability and performance by using the AWS global network to optimize the route to our application.

## Outposts

_AWS Outposts_ are "server racks" that offer the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs & tools to build our own applications on-premises just as in the cloud.

## WaveLength

_AWS WaveLength_ embeds AWS compute and storage services within 5g networks, providing mobile edge computing infrastructure for developing, deploying, and scaling ultra-low-latency applications.
