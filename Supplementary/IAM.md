# Identity and Access Management (IAM)

_IAM_ is a global service.

The _Least Privilege Principle_ is to not give users more permissions than they need.

IAM has some security tools available for use:

- **IAM Credentials Report** -- A report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials

- **IAM Access Advisor** -- Shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed
